				<h3>What is a commercial site?</h3>
				<p>A commercial site is a either a website that makes money for you (e.g. an ecommerce website),
				or a website that you develop for a third party who pay you to create their site. Basically if you
				make money from a website that uses the Ideal Image Slider you need a commercial license.</p>

				<h3>How do I get support?</h3>
				<p>When you purchase a commercial license you will recieve a license key in your receipt email. You
				can use this license key to access our <a href="http://dev7studios.com/support/help-desk">Support Help Desk</a>.</p>

				<h3>Package plugin with commercial products?</h3>
				<p>If you want to use the Ideal Image Slider in a product that you plan to sell (e.g. selling a premium
				WordPress theme on ThemeForest) you must purchase a Developer license.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col last">
				<h3>How can I pay?</h3>
				<p>We accept payments via credit card or via PayPal. Currently we can accept Visa, MasterCard
				and Discover credit cards.</p>

				<h3>What happens when my license expires?</h3>
				<p>Licenses are valid for one year. After this time your plugin will continue to work as is, but
				you will no longer be able to access our support help desk. Licenses can be renewed at a discounted
				rate.</p>

				<h3>What is your refund policy?</h3>
				<p>We offer a 30-day no-questions-asked refund policy to all customers. If you are not satisfied with
				our products for whatever reason, then simply <a href="http://dev7studios.com/contact">let us know</a>
				within 30 days of purchase and weâ€™ll refund you immediately.</p>
