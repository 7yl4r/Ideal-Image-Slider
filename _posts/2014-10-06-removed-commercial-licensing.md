title: Removed Commercial Licensing
---

A few weeks ago we announced commercial licensing for the Ideal Image Slider. While we hoped this might
prove a sustainable way to support the project, it has become apparent that this was simply too restrictive
for developers.

So today we are removing commercial licensing for the Ideal Image Slider. The plugin is now free for any use
(personal and commercial). The plugin will remain licensed under the GPL license.
