title: Commercial Licensing
---

Today we are announcing [commercial licensing]({{ site.url }}/download.html) for the Ideal Image Slider and are
moving the project from the MIT license to the GPL v3 license. We have decided to move to the GPL license to
accomodate for the dual-licensing model that we will now be using as it allows for a free (open source) license
and a commercial (proprietary) license to exist in harmony.

Why the change? Well [we are a software company](http://dev7studios.com) and although we love making open source
software we also like to be able to support ourselves (developers) so we can have jobs and continue making
awesome software. So from today if you use the Ideal Image Slider on a commercial website we ask that you
[purchase a commercial license]({{ site.url }}/download.html). You can continue to use the slider on personal
websites for free. More information can be found on the [download page]({{ site.url }}/download.html).
